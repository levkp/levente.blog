Hello! 👋🏻

I am a graduating applied computer science student from Hungary, living in Belgium. I like reading,
programming, and the great outdoors. 

I am interested in Java/Spring and PHP/Laravel development, cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes, and of course, 
all things Linux and free software. I strive for simple and elegant solutions, but I am also not afraid of
complexity, when it is necessary.

I will use this website to host my blog. It is for people who might want to get to know me, and for 
me to record whatever is on my mind.

You can contact me via
 - [Email](mailto:levente.blog.p9ovf@slmail.me) (this is an alias that forwards to my real address, but I reply from that one) 
 
 - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leventekataipal/) (can be viewed after login)
  
If you want, you can encrypt your message using my [PGP](https://levente.blog/pgp) key.
