Hello! 👋🏻

I am a junior devops engineer from Hungary, living in Belgium. I like reading, programming, researching my family tree
and the great outdoors.

I will use this website to host my blog. It is for people who might want to get to know me, and for me to record 
whatever is on my mind.

You can contact me via
 - [Email](mailto:levente.blog.p9ovf@slmail.me) (this is an alias that forwards to my real address, but I reply from that one)
 - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leventekataipal/) (my profile can be viewed after login)

If you want, you can encrypt your message using my [PGP](https://levente.blog/pgp) key.

My other links are (though my profiles are rather empty at the moment):

- [GitHub](https://github.com/levkp)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/lev.kp)
