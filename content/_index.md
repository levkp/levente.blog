I am a graduating applied computer science student from Hungary, studying in Antwerp, Belgium. I like reading,
programming, Linux, and a hike in the great outdoors. 

I will use this website to host my blog. It is for people who want to get to know me, and for me to write down and organize whatever's on my mind.

You can contact me via
 - [Email](mailto:levente.blog.p9ovf@slmail.me) (this is an alias that forwards to my real address, but I reply from that one) 
 
 - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leventekataipal/) (can be viewed after login)
  
If want, you can encrypt your message using my [PGP](https://levente.blog/pgp) key.
