I come from a young family. My mother was only 19 years old when I was born, and as a result, I was lucky to have known
not only all of my grandparents, but also no less than five of my great-grandparents. Three of them I remember very well, especially the father of my maternal grandmother.
We called him _Nagyapó_, which translates to _big old man_ literally but has a kinder, more affectionate tone to it in Hungarian[^1].

He was born in 1925 in the city of Békéscsaba, but later moved to Budapest, where he met my great-grandmother. He was
exempted from compulsory military service due to contracting polio. He and his family lived close to the core locations
of the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, and he personally witnessed the fall of the Stalin statue before the fights broke out.
They had 3 children, my grandma and her two brothers, whom I don't know too well. After the death of his wife in 2005, he moved in with my grandparents.
I often visited them after school. We played cards and chess, and he taught me how to play rummy, which remains my favourite card game.

My grandparents are both tech-savvy, at least by the standards of their generation. They bought Nagyapó a laptop
and taught him how to write emails. Recently, I have been digging through my inbox and came across his messages again. The earliest one I found, sent on June 19 of 2010, goes like this (original on the left):

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
    <blockquote>
        <p><b>Subject:</b> Névnapi köszöntés</p>
        <p>
            Kedves dédunokám – Levente!  Nevednapján szeretettel köszöntelek.
            Szüleid irányításával haladj tovább életed útján. Törekedj öcséid példaképe lenni.  
            Öreg barátod :  Apó.
        </p>  
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><b>Subject:</b> Name day greeting</p>
        <p>
            My dear great-grandson – Levente! I send my greetings with love on your name day.
            Continue your life under the guidance of your parents. Strive to be a role model for your younger brothers.
            Your old friend :  Apó.
        </p>

Name days are widely celebrated in Hungary[^2], and it's customary to send greetings to family members and close friends
on their name day(s). Sometimes, they are accompanied by words of wisdom. Here is another one addressed to my brother Benedek,
but sent to me:

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
    <blockquote>
        <p><b>Subject:</b> 2011. július 11.</p>
        <p>
            Szeretett dédunokám Benedek!  Védőszented ünnepén szeretettel köszöntelek. Növekedjél, gyarapodjál szeretetben , 
            szorgalomban továbbra is mindnyájunk örömére. Isten éltessen!   Apó.
        </p>  
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><b>Subject:</b> July 11, 2011</p>
        <p>
            My beloved great-grandson Benedek! I send my greetings with love on the feast day of your patron saint. 
            May you grow and thrive in love and diligence, bringing joy to us all. God bless you! Apó.
        </p>

I received this email on August 12 of 2010:

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
    <blockquote>
        <p><b>Subject:</b> Jegesmacik</p>
        <p>
            Kedves Unokák! Egy kis hűvös a nagy melegben..Apó
        </p>  
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><b>Subject:</b> Polar bears</p>
        <p>
            Dear Grandchildren! A bit of coolness in this great heat..Apó
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</div>

In the attachments was a PowerPoint presentation, containing nothing but images of polar bears. It was a forwarded email, but regardless, I find it cute that he found it important
to share it with his grandchildren.

And here is one more, which I received during the Easter of 2013:

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
    <blockquote>
        <p><b>Subject:</b> (nincs tárgy)</p>
        <p>
            Kegyelemmel  teljes husvétot kivánok az egész családnak:  Nagyapó.
        </p>  
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><b>Subject:</b> (no subject)</p>
        <p>
            I wish your whole family a graceful Easter:  Nagyapó.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</div>

Note that when these emails were written, he was between 85 and 88 years old. I find it fascinating that someone who lived through exactly 3/4 of the 20th century still got to own a personal computer and used it to communicate with others. He passed away later that year in 2013 in a rest home in the beautiful city of Pannonhalma. I don't remember much of this period other than visiting him once, but my grandmother tells me he enjoyed living there. This reassures me that he died in an environment he liked.

I feel grateful that I have known my great-grandfather, and I now regret not spending more time in his company. As I grew older, I began to realize how few people get to meet their great-grandparents, let alone multiple — and that even fewer can tell that they have received emails from one of them.

- [ ] ask grandma what laptop Nagyapó had, and if I can have it if she still has it, then update this post
