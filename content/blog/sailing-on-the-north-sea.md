About a year ago, my fiancée and I visited Lisbon. It was mesmerizing (especially the narrow alleys of Alfama), as one would anticipate from a historical capital city. I was, however, surprised by the sheer amount of other tourists with whom we had to share our experience. When I visit a city, I want to understand its history and try to act like a local, at least a little bit. This is not easy when everything is packed with tourists which constantly reminds me that I am just one of the many. Of course, we had no more right to be there than anyone else, so I do not mean to complain about the crowd, it's simply an observation.

This phenomenon of touristically overwhelmed cities is nothing new, but the by-product of industrial mass tourism that gradually took over the world since the 1960s[^1]. Elizabeth Becker writes in her book Overbooked that

> Travel is an extraordinary pleasure and was once a privilege. Now it is considered a basic right without limits or a sense of responsibility for how all this travel is affecting the places we love. [^2]

To some extent, travel is still a privilege, but it is more accessible than ever before. I think that it's good that more people can now afford to travel, not to mention all the jobs and prosperity the industry can create. In 2022, Portugal was the 11th most visited country in the world, generating €22.2 billion in tourism receipt[^3]. 

However, governing administrations should not act greedy and tourism needs to be regulated as soon as it starts to hurt the interest of the locals. This is clearly the case in Lisbon. An article from the BBC[^4] reports that

> [...] factors leading to the country's current housing crisis include what he refers to as "touristification" - when the rise in popularity of holiday rentals diverts homes from residential use to tourism.

> Areas like the historical neighbourhood of Alfama, known as the home of the Portuguese musical genre Fado, now have 60% of their houses in short-term rental use.


but that's enough for me to feel discouraged to keep on visiting the more well-known destinations.

I want to break out of the tourist bubble.

That's why I was excited when my fiancée heard about the Tall Ship Races from a friend, and asked me to participate together. You probably haven't heard about this event before, so let me just paste here the first paragraph from its Wikipedia article[^5]:

> The Tall Ships Races are races for sail training "tall ships". The races are designed to encourage international friendship and training for young people in the art of sailing. The races are held annually in European waters and consists of two racing legs of several hundred nautical miles, and a "cruise in company" between the legs. Over one half of the crew of each ship participating in the races must consist of young people. 

There is no sailing experience required, because participants join experienced crews as trainees. Most crews are made up of volunteers, they receive no salary for manning the ships. The fee trainees have to pay goes towards maintenance and supplies. **The sole purpose of the race is to meet new people, enjoy the sea and each other's company while working towards a common goal, that is, to navigate the vessel from A to B.** I think that that is amazing.

We were on the Roald Amundsen[^6], a traditional brig where the sails are rigged to the deck and have to be hoisted and lowered by human power. In the photo below, you can see some of the ropes tied to the so called cleats.

My team was scheduled to work from 8 am until noon, and again from 8 pm until midnight. This was a lucky arrangement, because it meant that we could more or less keep our normal sleep schedule. And, we got to see the sunset every day.

About a day after we sailed out, we were out of reach for any cell network. It was the perfect opportunity to disconnect, and it was a good feeling not being online for days.

The voyage also confirmed to me that high-performing teams must have crystal-clear communication. The main language on board was German, but many trainees, including us, did not speak the language. 



Smooth communication
Fredrikstad


A few days after our arrival in Fredrikstad, we joined the family of my fiancée, who just happened to spend their vacation near Oslo. 
There, we visited the Munch Museum. I was not only surprised by the large number of artworks Munch has produced, but also by the number of visitors who were taking photos like there was no tomorrow. There were QR codes under most if not all pieces, leading to a page containing the description and a high-resolution picture of the work, better than any taken with a smartphone. Many tourists just kept snapping quick photos and then immediately moving to the next exhibit, instead of taking the time to think about what is in front of them. They see, but they don't observe. They consume, but they don't digest. In other words, I was back in the tourist bubble.
