About a year ago, my fiancée and I visited Lisbon. It was mesmerizing, especially the narrow alleys of Alfama, as one would anticipate from a historical capital city. I was, however, surprised by the sheer number of other tourists with whom we had to share our experience. When I visit a city, I want to understand its history and try to blend in like a local, at least a little bit. This is not easy when everything is packed with tourists which constantly reminds me that I am just one of the many. Of course, we had no more right to be there than anyone else did, so I do not mean to complain about the crowd; it's simply an observation.

This phenomenon of cities being overwhelmed by tourists is nothing new, it is the by-product of industrial mass tourism that gradually took over the world since the 1960s[^1]. Elizabeth Becker writes in her book Overbooked

> Travel is an extraordinary pleasure and was once a privilege. Now it is considered a basic right without limits or a sense of responsibility for how all this travel is affecting the places we love. [^2]

To some extent, travel is still a privilege, but it is more accessible than ever. I think it's good that more people can now afford to travel, not to mention all the jobs and prosperity the industry can create. In 2022, Portugal was the 11th most visited country in the world, generating €22.2 billion in tourism receipt[^3]. 

However, governing administrations should not act greedily and tourism needs to be regulated as soon as it starts to hurt the interest of the locals. This is clearly the case in Lisbon. An article from the BBC[^4] reports that

> [...] factors leading to the country's current housing crisis include what he refers to as "touristification" - when the rise in popularity of holiday rentals diverts homes from residential use to tourism.

> Areas like the historical neighbourhood of Alfama, known as the home of the Portuguese musical genre Fado, now have 60% of their houses in short-term rental use.

Even though the rather cheap hostel where we stayed at probably doesn't play a major role in the problem, reading this article and Becker's book makes me feel discouraged to visit the most popular destinations. I want to break out of the tourist bubble.

That's why I was excited when my fiancée heard about the Tall Ship Races from a friend and asked me to participate together. You probably haven't heard about this event before, so let me paste here the first paragraph from its Wikipedia article[^5]:

> The Tall Ships Races are races for sail training "tall ships". The races are designed to encourage international friendship and training for young people in the art of sailing. The races are held annually in European waters and consists of two racing legs of several hundred nautical miles, and a "cruise in company" between the legs. Over one half of the crew of each ship participating in the races must consist of young people.

There is no sailing experience required because participants join experienced crews as trainees. Most crews are made up of volunteers, they receive no salary for manning the ships. The fee trainees have to pay goes towards maintenance and supplies. **The sole purpose of the race is to meet new people, enjoy the sea and each other's company while working towards a common goal: to navigate the vessel from A to B.** I think that's amazing.

We signed up to be on the Roald Amundsen[^6], which is a traditional brig. Its sails are rigged to the deck and have to be hoisted and lowered by human power. In the photo below, you can see some of the ropes tied to the so called cleats. When ordered, we had to untie certain ropes, pull or loosen them (in groups or alone, depending on the weight on the other end), and finally tie them all back. This was perhaps our most common task. Another chore was being on the lookout, which meant scouting the distance and reporting any object that appear on the horizon. This was important to avoid a possible collision - which could easily happen, so I was told. And indeed, I was surprised to see how many ships are on the sea at the same time[^7].

On July 8, we arrived at the port Hartlepool and boarded the vessel. Almost immediately, we were assigned to groups. Each group was scheduled to work two four-hour shifts a day. This way, everyone had eight hours to rest and eight hours to keep themselves busy with whatever they wanted. My team worked from 8 am until noon, and again from 8 pm until midnight. This was a fortunate arrangement, because it meant that we could more or less keep our normal sleep schedule. Plus, we got to see the sunset every day.

The next day, we departed, and as far as I remember we were out of reach for any cell network by the end of the day. My generation is terminally online, and a digital detox every now and then can only do us good. For me, this was the perfect opportunity to disconnect. Not having my cellphone within reach greatly reduced the urge to use it when I was bored, a habit I had been trying to get rid of. Though, I really wasn't bored often while on board. Unfortunately, I didn't keep a journal so I can only recall some of the more interesting events.

On July 10, we saw dolphins. They were riding the waves created by the ship, which allowed them to swim faster and more effortlessly. It's basically a free ride for these guys.

I think it was on the same day that I managed to overcome my fear of heights and climbed the mainmast. Well, half of it. I was comfortable once I attached my harness to the rig; it was the free climb upwards that creeped me out slightly.

A big storm hit us on July 13. Some waves seemed to reach heights of 3-4 meters.

We arrived in Fredikstad on July 14. A few days later, we joined the family of my fiancée, who happened to spend their vacation near Oslo. There, we visited the Munch Museum. I was not only surprised by the large number of artworks Munch has produced, but also by the number of visitors who were taking photos as if there was no tomorrow. There were QR codes under most, if not all pieces, leading to a webpage containing the description and a high-resolution picture of the work, better than any taken with a smartphone. Many tourists just kept snapping quick photos and then immediately moving to the next exhibit, instead of taking the time to think about what is in front of them. They saw, but they didn't observe. They consumed, but they didn't digest. In other words, I was back in the tourist bubble.
